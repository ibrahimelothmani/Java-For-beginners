        // Design Pattern in Java
        // Design Patterns are typical solutions to common problems in software design.
        // They represent the best practices used by experienced object-oriented software developers.
        // Design Patterns are categorized into three main types:
        // 1. Creational Patterns: Deal with object creation mechanisms.
        // 2. Structural Patterns: Deal with object composition.
        // 3. Behavioral Patterns: Deal with object collaboration and responsibility.
        // Some of the most common design patterns include:
        // 1. Singleton Pattern: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
        // 2. Factory Pattern: Provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
        // 3. Abstract Factory Pattern: Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
        // 4. Builder Pattern: Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation.
        // 5. Prototype Pattern: Creates new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype.
        // 6. Adapter Pattern: Allows incompatible interfaces to work together.
        // 7. Bridge Pattern: Separates an object’s interface from its implementation.
        // 8. Composite Pattern: Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.
        // 9. Decorator Pattern: Adds new functionality to an object dynamically.
        // 10. Facade Pattern: Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.
        // 11. Flyweight Pattern: Reduces the cost of creating and manipulating a large number of similar objects.
        // 12. Proxy Pattern: Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.
        // 13. Chain of Responsibility Pattern: Passes a request along a chain of handlers.
        // Each handler decides either to process the request or to pass it to the next handler in the chain.
        // 14. Command Pattern: Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations.
        // 15. Interpreter Pattern: Defines a grammatical representation for a language and provides an interpreter to deal with this grammar.
        // 16. Iterator Pattern: Provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
        // 17. Mediator Pattern: Defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact.
        // 18. Memento Pattern: Captures and externalizes an object’s internal state without violating encapsulation.
        // 19. Observer Pattern: Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
        // 20. State Pattern: Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.
        // 21. Strategy Pattern: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.
        // 22. Template Method Pattern: Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses.
        // 23. Visitor Pattern: Represents an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure.
        // 24. Null Object Pattern: Uses a null object to represent the absence of an object of a class.
        // 25. Data Access Object (DAO) Pattern: Separates the data access logic from the business logic.
        // 26. Service Locator Pattern: Provides a central registry for locating services.
        // 27. Dependency Injection Pattern: A technique in which an object receives its dependencies from an external source rather than creating them itself.
        // 28. Repository Pattern: Mediates between the domain and data mapping layers, acting like an in-memory domain object collection.
        // 29. Unit of Work Pattern: Maintains a list of objects affected by a business transaction and coordinates the writing out of changes.
        // 30. Active Record Pattern: An object that wraps a row in a database table or view, encapsulating the database access and business logic.
        // 31. Front Controller Pattern: A centralized controller that handles all requests for a web application.
        // 32. Intercepting Filter Pattern: Allows pre-processing and post-processing of requests and responses.
        // 33. MVC (Model-View-Controller) Pattern: Separates an application into three main components: Model, View, and Controller.
        // 34. MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) Pattern: A software architectural pattern that separates the development of the graphical user interface from the business logic.
        // 35. MVP (Model-View-Presenter) Pattern: A derivative of MVC that focuses on the separation of concerns.
        // 36. CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) Pattern: Separates read and write operations for a data store.
        // 37. Event Sourcing Pattern: Captures all changes to an application state as a sequence of events.
        // 38. Saga Pattern: Manages distributed transactions by coordinating a series of local transactions.
        // 39. Circuit Breaker Pattern: Prevents an application from repeatedly trying to execute an operation that is likely to fail.
        // 40. Bulkhead Pattern: Isolates different parts of an application to prevent a failure in one part from affecting the entire system.
        // 41. Throttling Pattern: Limits the number of requests that can be made to a service in a given time period.
        // 42. Rate Limiting Pattern: Controls the rate at which requests are processed.
        // 43. Bulkhead Pattern: Isolates different parts of an application to prevent a failure in one part from affecting the entire system.
        // 44. Circuit Breaker Pattern: Prevents an application from repeatedly trying to execute an operation that is likely to fail.
        // 45. Retry Pattern: Automatically retries a failed operation.
        // 46. Timeout Pattern: Sets a time limit for an operation to complete.
        // 47. Bulkhead Pattern: Isolates different parts of an application to prevent a failure in one part from affecting the entire system.
        // 48. Circuit Breaker Pattern: Prevents an application from repeatedly trying to execute an operation that is likely to fail.
        // 49. Retry Pattern: Automatically retries a failed operation.
        // 50. Timeout Pattern: Sets a time limit for an operation to complete.
